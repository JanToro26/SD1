Combination of the four initial SD Labs for the first assignment

6 files per technology which share the same purpose

    - InsultProducer: Produce the insults that will be on the existing insults list (INSULTS)
    - InsultConsumer: Pop insults from the queue and put in the list (INSULTS) if they are not on that yet.
    
    - InsultBroadcaster: Reads from the existing insults list (INSULTS) and broadcasts it into a specific channel (insult_channel).
    - InsultReceiver: Subscribed to the broadcaster's channel (insult_channel)
    
    - TextProducer: Pushes text periodically into a queue (work_queue), read later by InsultFilter, and gets the censored text returned.
    - InsultFilter: Reads strings from a queue (work_queue) replacing insults with CENSORED. To be able to stay updated, it's subscribed to a channel (insult_channel)

Project is distributed in several directories.
    -> The 4 technologies are inside a directory with their own name. 
    -> A 5th directory contains the implementation of the services using a combination of two technologies, in our case XML-RPC and RabbitMQ
    -> A tests directory contains the programmes used for single, multi-node and dynamic scaling tests. Their outputs are stored in .txt files
        stored alongside the other main directories.
    -> A hidden directory contains the test.yaml used for testing both XML-RPC and Pyro
